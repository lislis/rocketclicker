## Setup

This is an Express server with a Vue3 frontend.

Start the server with

`$ npm run start`

For local development of the frontend with hotreload `cd frontend` and run

`$ npm run dev`

The deployment assumes the built frontend to be served as static files by Express.

To prepare this build the frontend with `$ npm run build`. I just checked the built files into git for convenience.

If you want to try and separate backend and frontend feel free to mess around with the addresses. No guarantees given.
